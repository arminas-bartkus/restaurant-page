        <h2>Meet The Team</h2>

        <h3>Carmen, Executive Chef</h3>
        <p>Trained at The French Laundry and Noma, Carmy returned to Chicago after a career in 
            Michelin-starred kitchens to transform his family’s sandwich shop into a fine dining destination. 
            He leads the kitchen with relentless precision and creative intensity.</p>

        <h3>Syndey, Chef de Cuisine</h3>
        <p>A rising star with classical training and bold instincts, Syd brings fresh energy and seasonal 
            focus to the menu. Partnered with Carmy, she helps shape The Bear’s evolving culinary identity 
            while managing the day-to-day on the line.</p>
        
        <h3>Richie, Front-of-House Manager</h3>
        <p>Once the loudest guy behind the counter, Richie redefined himself 
            through rigorous training at Ever. Now, he runs service 
            with purpose and polish, making every guest feel seen — and every table feel special.</p>
        
        <h3>Tina, Sous-Chef</h3>
        <p>A longtime cook at The Beef, Tina rose through the ranks and found her stride during 
            training at the Culinary Institute and Ever. 
            She's now a backbone of the kitchen, specializing in handmade pastas and mentoring new cooks.</p>
        
        <h3>Marcus, Pastry Chef</h3>
        <p>After honing his pastry skills during an intensive stage in Copenhagen, 
            Marcus returned to The Bear with a sharper technique and a global perspective.
